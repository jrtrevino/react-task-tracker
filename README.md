# React-Task-Tracker

A simple task tracker to learn the React Web Framework. 
This project taught me:

* Creating a react project with npm
* Building components and JSX
* Props and PropTypes
* Styling with CSS
* Events
* State and Hooks
* useEffect && Fetching, Deleting, and Updating data from a mock JSON server
* Routing/Linking

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Also initiates json-server package with a db.json file

Many thanks to traversymedia for the help!!
